Hospitals have different prices for said injury, and patients want the best “bang” for their buck. In most instances, they want to spend the least amount of money possible, as they would be paying out of pocket for the procedure. ECHO Sort aims to allow users to find a hospital based on an injury from a list of given injuries from a diagnosis-related group. You can sort these hospitals by preference of price for given injury or the distance the hospital is from your location, thus allowing you to pick one that suits your urgency as well as economic restrains. </div>
